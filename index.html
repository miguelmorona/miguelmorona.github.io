						<h2>About me</h2>
						
						<p> I am a math student who loves applying them to everyday life challenges. I value the power of mathematics in such different fields. 
						    I am a very curious person and this character led me to study a majoring in economathematics and math modeling. 
						    My passion for mathematics grew and I saw its application to cryptography, a field that I always love to learn more.
						    <br>
						    <br> 
						    Before, I graduated with a bachelor of science in <strong> Mathematical Engineering </strong> at <strong>Complutense University of Madrid, 2022</strong>
						    with a honorific mention on the bachelor's thesis. Besides, this thesis was given a prize by the ITEFI and CCN as the best spanish bachelor thesis
						    in "Cryptography and information security" in 2023. After this bachelor, I obtained a master's degree in <strong> Mathematical Engineering </strong> at <strong>Complutense University of Madrid, 2023</strong>.
						    <br>
						    <br>
						    Once I finished my studies in Madrid I decided to start a PhD program at University of Vigo, city where I am living in currently.

						<h2>Interests</h2>
						 
						<p> In my cryptography career, I have worked as a research intern at IMDEA Software Institute with Dario Fiore and Ignacio Cascudo. The main topics in the two
						    internships I had with them were about Verifiable Computation and Homomorphic encryption. That experience led me to work with Fernando Pérez and Alberto Pedrouzo in Vigo. 
						</p>
						<p> 	
						    I enjoy playing chess. I play since I am 5 years old and I am happy to have been part of a chess club, CDV Vallecas, for more than 15 years. My interest in chess goes beyond playing.
						    I have taught chess to children in Madrid and I definitely loved doing that.
